# hexOS

this is the, like, fifth, revision of my personal website! inspired by the [Personal WebOS](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/webOS) hack club jam, you can open and close "apps" to learn more about me. since that doesn't really work well on mobile, i've created seperate, simpler, css for mobile, which I think is the first time one of my sites works on mobile!

the site has five apps:

- about me - a holy yapparonie on what my deal is
- links - links to all my socials and stuff
- projects - a listing of my projects
- explore - 88x31 badges, webrings, etc
- uses - the stuff I use everyday!
- guestbook - leave comments and reactions on the site

hexOS was built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), using the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/tailwindcss) color palette and [Hack Club icons](https://icons.hackclub.com/).

Guestbook made with [giscus](https://giscus.app/). Window dragging code from [Hack Club Jams](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/webOS/part-3#Making%20The%20Window%20Movable).

on AI: Claude/ChatGPT was used for some debugging, but many of its solutions were straight up wrong or didn't work. Huh. JetBrains local full line completions were also used.
